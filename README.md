## Project Overview

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** conducted on a book sales dataset. The goal is to understand publishing market dynamics through three main perspectives:

| Axis | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Market Analysis** | Identify top-performing genres, authors, and time periods |
|  **Author Performance** | Evaluate the impact of an author’s reputation on sales and ratings |
| **Trend Analysis** | Detect evolving reading preferences and publishing patterns |

## Main Insights

### Genre fiction dominates the market  
Genre fiction alone generates over **1.6 million in gross sales**, more than 7× higher than nonfiction (second place). Inventory and marketing strategies should prioritize this segment.

### Low prices = high volume  
Books priced below **€10** account for the vast majority of high sales volumes (30,000–60,000 units). Above €15, sales drop sharply. Affordable pricing is a key driver of volume.

###  Average rating does not predict sales  
Despite nearly zero correlation between `Book_average_rating` and `units sold`, most books cluster around **4.0/5**. Visibility and author reputation are more influential than perceived quality alone.

### Series build loyalty and drive sales  
The top 10 authors are dominated by creators of **long-running series** (Stephen King, Janet Evanovich, Jim Butcher, Robert Jordan). Series-based engagement is a structural competitive advantage in the publishing industry.

### Publishing boom since the 2000s  
The number of annual publications has grown **exponentially** since the 2000s, peaking around 2010–2015. This increased competition makes data-driven decision-making more critical than ever for publishers.
